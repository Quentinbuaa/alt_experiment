Usage write in 2016 09 18

there are 3 key files in the directory: 
1. run.sh used to run the bug program. Writing this to seperate script is for that the Java classpath can't be configurated correctly and I loose patient to find out a clean way. In this method, the Java is running in the user's environment, so that the user's java_home and classpath can be used correctly.
2. cgroup_set.sh is use to set the cgroup environment. This is write specially is because it have to use the root user to set the cgroup environment. SoI have to write is seperately.
3. the memory_test.sh is used to control the whole test. So, in order to run the whole program, all need to do is ./memory_test.sh. 
This scripts contains three parts. The first part is for the data directory set up. The second part is for the configuration of cgroup. In this part, all we have to do to call the script of cgroup_set.sh. After the testing environment is ready, the third part, we can run our program with command cgexec.This command have to use sudo. Then the run.sh's output's owner is root. The monitor switch also belongs to this part. I implement the monitor part with a simple function instead of scripts.
